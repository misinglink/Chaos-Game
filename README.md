# Chaos-Game
exploring the outcome of incorporating the chaos game algorithm to n-sided polygons.

It has bren found that changing the distance to the next vertex dramatically changes the view of the picture. In some sets the picture is orderly, in other set the picture is chaotic.

The next question, what drives these sets domains for different n-sided polygons??
